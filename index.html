<h2> Story Line </h2>

		<p><img src="apollo11.jpg" alt="Apollo 11" style="float:right;width: 150px;height :200px;">People who think that the Apollo moon landings were not all that they seemed at the time believe that Nasa faked some or all of the landings. Some of the theories surrounding this subject are that the Apollo astronauts did not land on the Moon; Nasa and possibly others intentionally deceived the public into believing the landings did occur by manufacturing, destroying, or tampering with evidence, including photos, telemetry tapes, transmissions, and rock samples; and that Nasa and possibly others continue to actively participate in the conspiracy to this day.</p>
		<p>Those who think that Nasa faked some or all of the landings base their theories on photographs from the lunar surface which they claim show camera crosshairs partially behind rocks, a flag planted by Buzz Aldrin moving in a strange way, the lack of stars over the lunar landscape and shadows falling in different direction. Many commentators have published detailed rebuttals to the hoax claims, and these theories have been generally discounted but belief in them - particularly on the web - persists.</p>
		<div class="view">
		<p>Personally, I don't believe that the moon landing could be faked. Back when we first landed on the moon, we didn't have the advanced technology like we do today. So faking a photo like that is almost near impossible. Even if the photo was somehow manipulated, it would have already been disproven by now.
